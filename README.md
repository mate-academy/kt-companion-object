# Remove Letters
Our friend can't stand the `r` letter (no joke). Can you help him get rid of them in the text?

Create the companion object with `removeLetter()` function. It should accept the `String input` variable and return an array of characters. 
In the array, all letters have to be lowercase, and all `r` characters must be replaced with `!`. 

ðŸ’¡ Make sure to treat the `removeLetter()` method as a static method in Java code!

For instance:
```kotlin
//input example
val input = "Remove Letters"

//result example
['!', 'e', 'm', 'o', 'v', 'e', ' ', 'l', 'e', 't', 't', 'e', '! ', 's']
```
