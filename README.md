# Remove Letters
Our friend can't stand the **`r`** letter (no joke). Can you help him get rid of them in the text?

Create the companion object with **`removeLetter()`** function. It should accept the **`String input`** variable and return an array of characters. 
In the array, all letters have to be lowercase, and all **`r`** characters must be replaced with **`!`**. 

💡 Make sure to treat the **`removeLetter()`** method as a static method in Java code!

**Example**
```kotlin
//input example
val input = "Remove Letters"

//result example
['!', 'e', 'm', 'o', 'v', 'e', ' ', 'l', 'e', 't', 't', 'e', '! ', 's']
```
